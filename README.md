The software has been developed at tested on MATLAB 9.2, Release 2017a.

## MATLAB Software implementations of the Shape and Affine Invariant descriptor

For example usage refer to the MATLAB scripts in directory 'Testing\comparision'.

Before running any tests, the test datasets 'Affine regions' and 'OxFrei' should be downloaded as explained in 
[this README.md file](https://github.com/NLeSC/LargeScaleImaging/tree/master/Data)

The funciton 'config.m' contains important common parameters for the rest of  the software.
